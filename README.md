# Local GPU With PyTorch

Following along with an article I used to get me going with PyTorch using my local GPU. Well, mostly following along. I added a bit here and there and gave it my own voice. Nothing against the Geeks For Geeks article I boogled this from, but why not? No credit belongs to me.

By the way, if you use the YAML here to create your own conda environemnt, there will be an error with the torch stuff. Remedy this by visiting the ["Start Locally"](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) page from PyTorch to build the right command for you. That should fix you up.

Enjoy yourself.
